# Assets, Threats ,and Vulnerabilities

**Risk** : Anything that can impact the Confidentiality, integrity, (or) availability of an assets.

## Security risk planning

They are based on the analysis of three elements. They represents what, why, and how of security.

  - **Assets** : It is an item perceived as having value to an organization.
    
  - **Threats** : Any circumstance (or) event that can negatively impact assets.
    
  - **Vulnerabilities** : A weakness that can be exploited by a threat.

  -  Restricted ---> Highly sensitive

## Data
It is information that is translated, Processed, or Stored by a computer.Protecting data is one of the most importent task for security analyst.

### States of data
  - Data in use
  
  - Data in transit
  
  - Data in rest

**Data in Use** : Data being accessed by one (or) more users.

**Data in transit** : Data traveling from one point to another.

**Data in rest** : Data not currenlty being accessed.

## Information security (infosec) :

The Practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users. weak infosec is a serious problem and it can lead to things like identity theft, financial loss, and reputational damage.

## Cloud security challenges :
All service provides do their best to deliver secure products to their customers. but since data is stored in the cloud & accessed over the internet, Several challenges arise.

  - **Misconfiguration** : It is one of the biggest concerns. customers of cloud based services are responsible for configuring their own security environment.
  
  - **Cloud-native breaches** : They are more likely to occur due to misconfigured services.

  - **Monitoring access might be difficult** : It depending on the client & level of service.

  - **Meeting regulatory standards** : Practiculary in industries that are required by law to follow specific requirements such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR.

Types of risk categories
    
  - Damage
  - Disclosure
  - Loss of information
    
## Elements of a security plan

  - **Policy** : It is a set of rules that reduces risk and protects information. They are the foundation of every security plan. they give everyone in and out of an organization guidance by addressing questions like, what are we protecting and why. Policies focuses on the strategic side of things by identifying the scope, objectives, and limitations of a security plan.

  - **Standards** : They concern how well we're protecting assets. in security, standards are refereces that inform how to set policies they create a point pf reference.
