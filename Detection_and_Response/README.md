# NIST CSF:

The Five Core funtions of the NIST CSF are identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. the last three steps called detect, respond, and recover are critical stages during incident response. the NIST incident response lifecycle is another NIST framework with steps dedicated to incident response.

1) Prepation
2) Detection and analysis
3) Containment Eradication
4) Recovery
5) Post Incident activity

its not a linear process, so steps can overlap as new discovers are made.

## Incident :
It is an occurence that actually (or) imminently jeopardizes, without lawful authority, the confidentiality, integrity, (or) availability of information (or) an information system, (or) Constitutes a violation (or) imminent threat of violation of law, security policies, Security procedures, (or) acceptable use policies.

**NOTE**:  All Security incidents are events, but not all events are security incidents.

**Event** : An Observable Occurrence on a network, system, (or) device.

### The 5 W's of an incident

  - Who Triggered the incident
  - What happened
  - When the incident took place
  - Where the incident took place
  - Why the incident Occured

### Incident handler's journal : 
It is a form of documentation used in incident response.

## Computer Security incident responce teams (CSIRT) :

A Specialized group of security professionals that are trained in incident management and response. The goal of CSIRT are to effectively and efficiently manage incidents, Provide Services and resources for response and recovery, and to prevent future incidents.

### Roles in CSIRT :

  - Security analyst --> They investigate security alerts to determine if an inc has occured
  - Technical lead --> They
