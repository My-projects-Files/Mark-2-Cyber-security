# Security Hardening

It refers to the process of reducing vulnerabilities in systems like networks, cloud environments, servers, and applicationsâ€”to protect them from threats, attacks, and unauthorized access.

## Network Security hardening

It focuses on network related security hardening like

  - Port Filtering
  - Network access privilege
  - Encryption

Some network hardening tasks are performed regulated while some are performed once and updated overtime. some common tasks performed are

  - Firewall rules maintenance
  - Network Log analysis
  - Patch updates
  - Server backups

## Network Log Analysis

It is the process of examining network logs to identify events of interest. security teams use a log analyzer tool (or) security information and event management tool (SIEM), to conduct network log analysis

**Port Filtering** : it is a firewall funtion that blocks (or) allows certain port numbers to limit unwanted communication.

## Intrusion detection system (IDS) :

An IDS is an application that monitors systems activity and alerts on possible intrusion. An IDS alerts admins based on the signature of malicious traffic. It is configured to detect known attacks.
They sniff data packets as they move across the analyze for the characteristics of known attacks.
