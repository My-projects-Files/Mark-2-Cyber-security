How users communication with the system to performa task.

__User__ ---> __Application__ ---> __Operating system__ ---> __Hardware__

 **Application**: It is a program that performs a specific task.

### Virtualization :

It is the process of using software to create virtual representation of various physical machines. Virtual system dont use dedicated physical hardware instead, they use software - defined versions of the physical hardware. we can run multiple vms using the physical hardware of a single PC. This involves dividing the resources of the host PC.

Benefits of VMS

  - Security
  - Efficiency

Other form of Virtualization, some dont use OS.
  
  - Multiple Virtual servers from a single physical server
  - Virtual network

## User Interface
