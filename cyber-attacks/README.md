## Cyber Attacks

- **Computer Virus** : Malicious code written to interfier with computer operations and cause damage to data and software.

- **Malware** : Software Designed to harm hardware devices (or) networks.

## Two Major Cyber attacks

Historic cyber attacks which bought cyber security in play

### Brain Virus
The Brain virus is the first computer virus for MS-DOS systems — and one of the earliest known computer viruses ever created. It originated in 1986, created by two brothers in Pakistan.

**Intent**: Track illegal copies of medical software and prevent pirated licencing.

**Working**:Brain was a boot sector virus, meaning it infected the boot sector of floppy disks.When a computer booted from an infected disk, the virus loaded into memory and could infect other disks inserted later.It stored the original boot sector elsewhere and showed no immediate symptoms, making it hard to detect.The virus also included a "message" from its creators, listing their names, address, and phone number.

**Impact**: This will slow down access, and data loss, corrupted system instability, unintended consequences. No Physical damage to the computer hardware.

### Morris Worm
Created by Robert Tappan Morris, a graduate student at Cornell University.Released on November 2, 1988, from an MIT-connected system. It was the first worm to self-replicate across the early Internet (ARPANET), infecting approximately 6,000 of 60,000 connected Unix systems (~10%).

**Intent**: To access the size of the internet.it will go to internet & install itself in otherr computers to tally the nuber of computer connected to web.

**Damage**: It failed to track the compromised computers,and continued to reinstall itself , untill the PC ran out of memory and crashed.

**Legal Legacy**: It led to the first US felony conviction under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Morris received community service, probation, and a fine.

**Birth of CERT/CC**: Prompted the U.S. government to establish the "Computer Emergency Response Team" for coordinated incident response.

## Two Major Malicious Cyber attacks

Two Major internet attacks

### The Love letter attack

The ILOVEYOU virus, also called the "Love Letter" worm, was one of the most damaging and widespread email-based malware attacks in history, launched in May 2000.

**Purpose**: Created to steal internet login credentials.

**Working**: User Received an email with subject "I LOVE YOU" and an attachment. once the attachment is opened, it will scan users address book. it autosends itself to people on the list.Then it install program to collect user info and passwords.

### Equifax breach

**Purpose**: Attacker infiltrated credit reporting agency equifax. This is largest known data breachesh of sensitive info.

**Cause**: Multiple failures on equifax, including multiple vulnerabilities in company infra.


## Phishing
Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. 

Some of the most common types of phishing attacks today include: 

- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**: A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.

- **Spear phishing**: A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.

- **Whaling**: A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.

- **Vishing**: The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

- **Smishing**: The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

## Malware
Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks. There are many types of malware. The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organization, or a territory.  

Some of the most common types of malware attacks today include: 

- **Viruses**: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.

- **Worms**: Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.

- **Ransomware**: A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. Once deployed, it can freeze network system, leave devices unusable, and encrypt, (or) lock confidential data.

  Note: When ransome negotiations occure (or) data is leaked by threat actors, these events can occure through dark web.

- **Spyware**: Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.


## Social Engineering 
Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question. It’s the mission of a threat actor, acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many people as possible. 

Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include:

- **Social media phishing**: A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.

- **Watering hole attack**: A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.

- **USB baiting**: A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network. 

- **Physical social engineering**: A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

## Social engineering principles 
Social engineering is incredibly effective. This is because people are generally trusting and conditioned to respect authority. The number of social engineering attacks is increasing with every new social media application that allows public access to people's data. Although sharing personal data—such as your location or photos—can be convenient, it’s also a risk.

Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include:

- **Authority**: Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures. 

- **Intimidation**: Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told. 

- **Consensus/Social proof**: Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past. 

- **Scarcity**: A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply. 

- **Familiarity**: Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.  

- **Trust**: Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited over time. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.

- **Urgency**: A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.

## Password Attacks
It is an attack to access secure devices, system, network or data.

- **Brute Force** :  A brute force attack tries every possible combination of characters until it finds the correct password.

- **Rainbow Table** : This attack falls under the communication & network security Domain. A rainbow table attack is a precomputed table of hashes for a large         list of passwords.

## Advanced AI

It is a technique that manipulates AI like machine learning, deep learning, and automation to conduct attack More efficiently.

## Supplychain Attack

It targets system, application, hardware & Software to locate a vulnerabilitys, where malware can be deployed.

As every item sold undergoes a process that involves third part, This means security breaches can occure in any point in supply chain.

## Cryptographic attack

Cryptographic attacks are attempts by attackers to break or bypass encryption and security algorithms in order to gain access to sensitive data like passwords, messages, or keys.

It affects secure forms of communcation between a sendoe and intended recipient.

- **Birthday**
- **Collision**
- **Downgrade**

It also comes under communication and network security.

# Treat actor Types

## Advanced persistent threats (APT)
This treat actors have significent experties accessing an organisation network without authorization.

**Intensions** :
  - Damage critical infrastrecture, such as power grids and natural resources.
  - Gaining access to intellectual property, trade secrets (or) Patents.

## Insider threats

They abuse their authority access to obtain data that may harm an organisation.

**Intensions** :
  - Sabotage
  - Corruption
  - Espionage
  - leaks

## Hacktivists

They are driven by political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals.

**Intensions** :
  - Demonstrations
  - Propaganda
  - Fame
  - Social change campaigns

# Hacker Types

## Ethical Hacker :
Authorized hacker, An ethical hacker (also known as a white-hat hacker) is a cybersecurity professional who uses hacking techniques legally and ethically to help organizations identify and fix security vulnerabilities.

  **Goals** : Their goal is to protect systems, not exploit them.

## Semi-Ethical Hacker :
A semi-ethical hacker, also known as a gray hat hacker or independent security researcher, operates between legal and illegal boundaries. They don’t have explicit permission to test a system but don’t intend to cause harm either.

  **Goals** : They search vulnerabilities, but dont take advantages of the system.

## Un-Ethical Hacker :
Unethical hackers, also known as black hat hackers, are individuals or groups who use their technical skills to gain unauthorized access to systems for personal gain, disruption, theft, or espionage.

  **Goals** : They operate illegally and with malicious intent, unlike ethical or gray hat hackers.

## Common strategies used to manage risks:

- **Acceptance** : Accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity.
- **Avoidince** : Creating a plan to avoid risk altogether.
- **Transference** : Transferring risk to a third part to manage.
- **Mitigation** : Lessening the impact of an known risk.

###  Common network intrusion attacks

  - Malware
  - Spoofing
  - Packet Sniffing
  - Packet flooding

### Attacks can harm an organization by

  - Leaking valuable (or) Confidential information
  - Damage an organizations reputation
  - Impacting customer retention
  - Costing money and time

**Backdoor Attacks** : A backdoor attack is another type of attack you will need to be aware of as a security analysts. in cybersecurity, backdoors are weaknesses intentionally left by programmers (or) system and network administrators that bypass normal access control machanisms. They are intended to help programmers conduct troubleshooting (or) administrative tasts. however they can also be installed by attackes.

**Denial of Service Attack (DOS)** : It is an attack that target a network (or) server and floods it with network traffic. objective is to disrupt normal business operations by overloading an organizations network.

**Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDOS)** : A Type of denial of service attack that uses multiple devices (or) servers in different locations to flood the target network with unwanted traffic.

## Common network level DOS Attack :

**Synchronize (SYN) Flood attack** : A type of DOS attack that simulates a TCP Connection and floods a server with SYN Packets. To establish a TCP connection from a device to a server, the device sends (SYN) Packets next the server sends (SYN/ACK) to the device. 

Then once the device sends (ACK) to the server TCP connection is established. Threat actors take advantage by flooding a server with (SYN) Packets. if the packets are larger then number of available ports on the server, then server will become unavailable.

**Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP) Flood** :
ICMP is An internet Protocol used by devices to tell each other about data transmission errors across the network.

A Type of DOS attack performed by an attacker repeatedly sending ICMP Packets to a network server. This forces the server to send an ICMP Packet. This eventually uses up all the bandwidth for incoming and outgoing traffic and causes the server to crash.

**Ping of Death** : A type of DOS attack caused when a hacker pings a system by sending in an oversized ICMP packet that is bigger than 64KB.

## Packet Sniffing
It is a practice of using software tools to observe data as it moves across a network. As an analyst, we may use packet sniffing to analyze and capture packets when investing ongoing incidents (or) debugging network issues.

Type of packet sniffing
  - Passive packet sniffing
  - Active packet sniffing
    
**Passive Packet Sniffing** : A type of attack where data packets are read in transit.

**Active Packet Sniffing** : A type of attack where data packets are manipulated in transit.

We can prevent packet sniffing using
    - VPN
    - Only access website with https
    - Avoid using unprotected wifi (like inpublic places)

## IP Spoofing :
A network attack performed when an attacker changes the sourcec IP of a data packet to implersonate an authorized system and gain access to a network.

Common IP Spoofing attacks
  - On-path attack
  - Replay attack
  - Smurf attack

**On-path attack** : An attack where a malicious actor places themselves in the middle of an authorized connection and intercepts (or) alters the data in transit.

**Replay attack** : A network attack performed when a malicious actor intercepts a data packet in transit and delays it (or) repeats it at another time.

**Smurf attack** : A network attack performed when an attacker sniffs an authorized users IP address and floods it with packets.

Steps to prevents IP Spoofing
  - Encript the data in transit
  - Configure Firewall

## Zero-day exploit:

It is an exploit that was previously unknown. when they happen, they can leave assets even more vulnerable to threats then they alredy are.
