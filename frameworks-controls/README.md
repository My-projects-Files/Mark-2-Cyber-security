## Security Frameworks
Security frameworks are structured sets of guidelines, best practices, and standards designed to help organizations secure their systems, data, and operations against cyber threats.

  **Goals** : They provide a blueprint for building a strong, consistent, and compliant security posture. it provides strectured approach to implement a security lifecycle

## Security Lifecycle 

The Security Lifecycle is a cyclical process used to continuously manage and improve security in an organization. It ensures that security measures are planned, implemented, monitored, and updated to adapt to evolving threats.

## Purpose of Security Frameworks

It is used to

- **Protect PII**
- **Securing Financial info**
- **Identifying Security weaknesses**
- **Managing Organisation Risks**
- **Aligning security with business goals**

## Four Core components of framework

- **Identifying and Documenting security goals**
- **Setting guidlines to achieve security goals**
- **Implementing strong security processes**
- **Monitoring and communicating results**

**NOTE**: General Data Protection regualted by EU (GDRP). it is a data protection law established to grant European citizens more control over their personal data.

## Security Controls

Security controls are safeguards or countermeasures put in place to detect, prevent, reduce, or correct security risks. They help protect systems, networks, data, and users from threats like unauthorized access, breaches, or malware.

EX: If an organisation has all its employees to complete a training as part of complicane. As an analyst we may use a tool to auto assign and track which employees completed the tasks.

**Asset**: An item perceived as having value to an organisation.

## CIA Triad - The Foundation of Information Security

The CIA Triad is a core concept in cybersecurity that represents the three primary principles used to protect information:

 - **Confidentiality** :  Ensuring only authorized users can access sensitive data.
 - **Integrity**       :  Ensuring data is accurate, consistent, and trustworthy.
 - **Availability**    :  Ensuring data and systems are accessible when needed.


## NIST (National institue of standards and technology)

It is a U.S based agency that develops multiple voluntary compliances framework that organisations worldwide can use to help manage risk.

The more aligned an organisation is with compliance, the lower the risk.

NOTE: The guidelines and specifications can change depending on the type of organisation.

EX: Some of the framework includes

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**
- **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):

A voluntary framework that helps organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. It’s high-level, flexible, and widely used across industries, including private and public sectors.

**Purpose** : To identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats.

### NIST Risk Management framework (RMF):

A detailed, mandatory framework (especially for U.S. federal agencies) focused on the full lifecycle of managing system security and risk — from categorization to ongoing monitoring.

**Purpose** : To help secure information systems by integrating cybersecurity, privacy, and risk management activities into the system development life cycle (SDLC).

There are seven steps in RMF
 - prepare
 - categorize
 - select
 - implement
 - assets
 - authorize
 - monitor

 **Prepare** : Activities that are necessary to manage ecurity and privacy risks before a breach occurs.
 
 **Categorize** : It is used to develop risk management processes and tasks.

 **Implement** : It is used to implement security and privacy plan for the organization.

 **Assets** : determine if establised controls are implemented correctly.

 **Authorized** : Being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organisation.

 **Monitor** : Be aware of how systems are operating.
 
## International Organization for Standardization (ISO) :

ISO was created to establish international standards related to technology, manifactoring, and management across borders. it help organisations improve their processes and procedure for staff retention, planning, waste and services.

## Payment card industry data security standard (PCI DSS):

It is an international security standard meant to ensure that organisation store, accepts, processes and transmits credit card information can only be done in secure environment.

**Purpose** : PCI DSS Objective is to reduce credit card fraud.
